Why This Suite Matters
DomaAuctionX → solves expiring domain transparency.
DomaDutchX → boosts engagement & participation.
DomaMarketX → builds long-term liquidity & secondary markets.
Together, these three dApps revolutionize DomainFi by making domains liquid, fair, and DeFi-native.
DomaAuctionX – Sealed-Bid Expiring Domain Auctions
Tagline: Fair, transparent price discovery for premium & expiring domains.
Description
DomaAuctionX automatically detects and lists expiring domains using Doma Oracles, running sealed-bid commit–reveal auctions. Buyers submit encrypted bids, ensuring no sniping or insider advantage. At reveal, the highest valid bidder wins, with on-chain settlement and domain transfer via Doma bridges.
Key Features
Auto-listing of expiring domains.
Commit–reveal sealed-bid auctions.
Dynamic reserve pricing via Doma Oracles.
Real-time notifications for participants.
On-chain settlement + Web2 domain handover.
2️⃣ DomaDutchX – Gamified Dutch Auctions
Tagline: Dynamic, gamified auctions to maximize engagement and liquidity.
Description
DomaDutchX introduces Dutch-style descending-price auctions with gamification mechanics. Domains start at a high reserve price and drop incrementally until purchased. To boost participation, it adds game-like incentives such as bonus points for early bids, streak rewards, and community jackpots funded by auction fees.
Key Features
Dutch auction pricing with dynamic intervals.
Doma Oracle integration for real-time market benchmarks.
Gamified participation → streaks, leaderboards, and prize pools.
Community engagement tools (lottery from auction fees).
On-chain, transparent settlements.
3️⃣ DomaMarketX – Fee-Optimized Domain Marketplace
Tagline: Low-cost, liquid marketplace for domain-as-RWA trading.
Description
DomaMarketX is a secondary marketplace for domain RWAs where users can list, trade, and settle domains fully on-chain. Unlike centralized brokers, it optimizes for low fees, liquidity, and trustless settlement. Buyers and sellers can use DeFi primitives (escrow, lending, fractional ownership) for advanced use cases.
Key Features
Peer-to-peer domain trading with minimal fees.
On-chain escrow contracts for safe swaps.
Fee rebates for high-volume traders.
Support for fractionalized domain ownership (domain shares as tokens).
Integration with Web2 registrars for automated transfer execution.
